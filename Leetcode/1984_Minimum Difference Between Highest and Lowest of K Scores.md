# 1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores

---

You are given a **0-indexed ** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the score of the `ith` student. You are also given an integer `k`.

Pick the scores of any `k` students from the array so that the **difference ** between the **highest ** and the **lowest ** of the `k` scores is **minimized **.

Return _the **minimum ** possible difference_.

 

**Example 1:**


**Input:** nums = [90], k = 1
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
- [**_90_ **]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
The minimum possible difference is 0.


**Example 2:**


**Input:** nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
- [**_9_ ** ,**_4_ ** ,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- [**_9_ ** ,4,**_1_ ** ,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- [**_9_ ** ,4,1,**_7_ **]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- [9,**_4_ ** ,**_1_ ** ,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- [9,**_4_ ** ,1,**_7_ **]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- [9,4,**_1_ ** ,**_7_ **]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
The minimum possible difference is 2.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000`
  * `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`

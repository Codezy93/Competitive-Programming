# 457. Circular Array Loop

---

You are playing a game involving a **circular ** array of non-zero integers `nums`. Each `nums[i]` denotes the number of indices forward/backward you must move if you are located at index `i`:

  * If `nums[i]` is positive, move `nums[i]` steps **forward ** , and
  * If `nums[i]` is negative, move `nums[i]` steps **backward **.



Since the array is **circular ** , you may assume that moving forward from the last element puts you on the first element, and moving backwards from the first element puts you on the last element.

A **cycle ** in the array consists of a sequence of indices `seq` of length `k` where:

  * Following the movement rules above results in the repeating index sequence `seq[0] -> seq[1] -> ... -> seq[k - 1] -> seq[0] -> ...`
  * Every `nums[seq[j]]` is either **all positive ** or **all negative **.
  * `k > 1`



Return `true` _if there is a **cycle ** in _`nums` _, or_`false` _otherwise_.

 

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/01/img1.jpg)


**Input:** nums = [2,-1,1,2,2]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The graph shows how the indices are connected. White nodes are jumping forward, while red is jumping backward.
We can see the cycle 0 --> 2 --> 3 --> 0 --> ..., and all of its nodes are white (jumping in the same direction).


**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/01/img2.jpg)


**Input:** nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,6]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The graph shows how the indices are connected. White nodes are jumping forward, while red is jumping backward.
The only cycle is of size 1, so we return false.


**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/01/img3.jpg)


**Input:** nums = [1,-1,5,1,4]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The graph shows how the indices are connected. White nodes are jumping forward, while red is jumping backward.
We can see the cycle 0 --> 1 --> 0 --> ..., and while it is of size > 1, it has a node jumping forward and a node jumping backward, so **it is not a cycle **.
We can see the cycle 3 --> 4 --> 3 --> ..., and all of its nodes are white (jumping in the same direction).


 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
  * `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
  * `nums[i] != 0`



 

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` extra space complexity?

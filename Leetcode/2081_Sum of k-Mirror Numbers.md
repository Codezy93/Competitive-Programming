# 2081. Sum of k-Mirror Numbers

---

A **k-mirror number ** is a **positive ** integer **without leading zeros ** that reads the same both forward and backward in base-10 **as well as ** in base-k.

  * For example, `9` is a 2-mirror number. The representation of `9` in base-10 and base-2 are `9` and `1001` respectively, which read the same both forward and backward.
  * On the contrary, `4` is not a 2-mirror number. The representation of `4` in base-2 is `100`, which does not read the same both forward and backward.



Given the base `k` and the number `n`, return _the **sum ** of the_ `n` _ **smallest ** k-mirror numbers_.

 

**Example 1:**


**Input:** k = 2, n = 5
**Output:** 25
**Explanation:** The 5 smallest 2-mirror numbers and their representations in base-2 are listed as follows:
  base-10    base-2
    1          1
    3          11
    5          101
    7          111
    9          1001
Their sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25. 


**Example 2:**


**Input:** k = 3, n = 7
**Output:** 499
**Explanation:** The 7 smallest 3-mirror numbers are and their representations in base-3 are listed as follows:
  base-10    base-3
    1          1
    2          2
    4          11
    8          22
    121        11111
    151        12121
    212        21212
Their sum = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 121 + 151 + 212 = 499.


**Example 3:**


**Input:** k = 7, n = 17
**Output:** 20379000
**Explanation:** The 17 smallest 7-mirror numbers are:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 121, 171, 242, 292, 16561, 65656, 2137312, 4602064, 6597956, 6958596


 

**Constraints:**

  * `2 <= k <= 9`
  * `1 <= n <= 30`

## Code
```python
class Solution:
  def kMirror(self, k: int, n: int) -> int:
    ans = 0
    A = ['0']
    def nextKMirror(A: list[str]) -> list[str]:
      for i in range(len(A) // 2, len(A)):
        nextNum = int(A[i]) + 1
        if nextNum < k:
          A[i] = str(nextNum)
          A[~i] = str(nextNum)
          for j in range(len(A) // 2, i):
            A[j] = '0'
            A[~j] = '0'
          return A
      return ['1'] + ['0'] * (len(A) - 1) + ['1']
    for _ in range(n):
      while True:
        A = nextKMirror(A)
        num = int(''.join(A), k)
        if str(num)[::-1] == str(num):
          break
      ans += num
    return ans
```

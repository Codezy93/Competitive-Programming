# 3084. Count Substrings Starting and Ending with Given Character

---

You are given a string `s` and a character `c`. Return _the total number of substrings of _`s` _that start and end with_`c` _._

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abada", c = "a"

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** Substrings starting and ending with `"a"` are: `"**_a_ ** bada"`, `"_ **aba **_ da"`, `"_ **abada **_ "`, `"ab _ **a **_ da"`, `"ab _ **ada **_ "`, `"abad _ **a **_ "`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "zzz", c = "z"

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** There are a total of `6` substrings in `s` and all start and end with `"z"`.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  * `s` and `c` consist only of lowercase English letters.

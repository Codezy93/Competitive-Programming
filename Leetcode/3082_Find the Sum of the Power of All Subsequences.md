# 3082. Find the Sum of the Power of All Subsequences

---

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and a **positive ** integer `k`.

The **power ** of an array of integers is defined as the number of subsequences with their sum **equal ** to `k`.

Return _the **sum ** of **power ** of all subsequences of_ `nums` _._

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo ** `109 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], k = 3 

**Output:** 6 

**Explanation:**

There are `5` subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

  * The subsequence `[_ **1 **_ ,_ **2 **_ ,_ **3 **_]` has `2` subsequences with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,_3_]` and `[_1_ ,_2_ ,3]`.
  * The subsequence `[_ **1 **_ ,2,_ **3 **_]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,_3_]`.
  * The subsequence `[1,_ **2 **_ ,_ **3 **_]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,_3_]`.
  * The subsequence `[_ **1 **_ ,_ **2 **_ ,3]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[_1_ ,_2_ ,3]`.
  * The subsequence `[1,2,_ **3 **_]` has `1` subsequence with `sum == 3`: `[1,2,_3_]`.



Hence the answer is `2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,3], k = 5 

**Output:** 4 

**Explanation:**

There are `3` subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

  * The subsequence `[_ **2 **_ ,_ **3 **_ ,_ **3 **_]` has 2 subsequences with `sum == 5`: `[_2_ ,3,_3_]` and `[_2_ ,_3_ ,3]`.
  * The subsequence `[_ **2 **_ ,3,_ **3 **_]` has 1 subsequence with `sum == 5`: `[_2_ ,3,_3_]`.
  * The subsequence `[_ **2 **_ ,_ **3 **_ ,3]` has 1 subsequence with `sum == 5`: `[_2_ ,_3_ ,3]`.



Hence the answer is `2 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], k = 7 

**Output:** 0 

**Explanation:  **There exists no subsequence with sum `7`. Hence all subsequences of nums have `power = 0`.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 100`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 104`
  * `1 <= k <= 100`

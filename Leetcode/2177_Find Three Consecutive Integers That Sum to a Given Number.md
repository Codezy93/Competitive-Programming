# 2177. Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number

---

Given an integer `num`, return _three consecutive integers (as a sorted array)__that **sum ** to _`num`. If `num` cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return _an **empty ** array._

 

**Example 1:**


**Input:** num = 33
**Output:** [10,11,12]
**Explanation:** 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.
10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].


**Example 2:**


**Input:** num = 4
**Output:** []
**Explanation:** There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers.


 

**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= num <= 1015`

# 1861. Rotating the Box

---

You are given an `m x n` matrix of characters `boxGrid` representing a side-view of a box. Each cell of the box is one of the following:

  * A stone `'#'`
  * A stationary obstacle `'*'`
  * Empty `'.'`



The box is rotated **90 degrees clockwise ** , causing some of the stones to fall due to gravity. Each stone falls down until it lands on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box. Gravity **does not ** affect the obstacles' positions, and the inertia from the box's rotation **does not ** affect the stones' horizontal positions.

It is **guaranteed ** that each stone in `boxGrid` rests on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.

Return _an_`n x m` _matrix representing the box after the rotation described above_.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** boxGrid = [["#",".","#"]]
**Output:** [["."],
         ["#"],
         ["#"]]


**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/rotatingtheboxleetcode2withstones.png)


**Input:** boxGrid = [["#",".","*","."],
              ["#","#","*","."]]
**Output:** [["#","."],
         ["#","#"],
         ["*","*"],
         [".","."]]


**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/rotatingtheboxleetcode3withstone.png)


**Input:** boxGrid = [["#","#","*",".","*","."],
              ["#","#","#","*",".","."],
              ["#","#","#",".","#","."]]
**Output:** [[".","#","#"],
         [".","#","#"],
         ["#","#","*"],
         ["#","*","."],
         ["#",".","*"],
         ["#",".","."]]


 

**Constraints:**

  * `m == boxGrid.length`
  * `n == boxGrid[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 500`
  * `boxGrid[i][j]` is either `'#'`, `'*'`, or `'.'`.

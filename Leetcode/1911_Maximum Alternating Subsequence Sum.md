# 1911. Maximum Alternating Subsequence Sum

---

The **alternating sum ** of a **0-indexed ** array is defined as the **sum ** of the elements at **even ** indices **minus ** the **sum ** of the elements at **odd ** indices.

  * For example, the alternating sum of `[4,2,5,3]` is `(4 + 5) - (2 + 3) = 4`.



Given an array `nums`, return _the **maximum alternating sum ** of any subsequence of _`nums` _(after **reindexing ** the elements of the subsequence)_.




A **subsequence ** of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, `[2,7,4]` is a subsequence of `[4,_2_ ,3,_7_ ,2,1,_4_]` (the underlined elements), while `[2,4,2]` is not.

 

**Example 1:**


**Input:** nums = [_4_ ,_2_ ,_5_ ,3]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** It is optimal to choose the subsequence [4,2,5] with alternating sum (4 + 5) - 2 = 7.


**Example 2:**


**Input:** nums = [5,6,7,_8_]
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** It is optimal to choose the subsequence [8] with alternating sum 8.


**Example 3:**


**Input:** nums = [_6_ ,2,_1_ ,2,4,_5_]
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** It is optimal to choose the subsequence [6,1,5] with alternating sum (6 + 5) - 1 = 10.


 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
  * `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`

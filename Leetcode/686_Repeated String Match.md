# 686. Repeated String Match

---

Given two strings `a` and `b`, return _the minimum number of times you should repeat string_`a` _so that string_ `b` _is a substring of it_. If it is impossible for `b`​​​​​​ to be a substring of `a` after repeating it, return `-1`.

**Notice:** string `"abc"` repeated 0 times is `""`, repeated 1 time is `"abc"` and repeated 2 times is `"abcabc"`.

 

**Example 1:**


**Input:** a = "abcd", b = "cdabcdab"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We return 3 because by repeating a three times "ab **cdabcdab ** cd", b is a substring of it.


**Example 2:**


**Input:** a = "a", b = "aa"
**Output:** 2


 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104`
  * `a` and `b` consist of lowercase English letters.

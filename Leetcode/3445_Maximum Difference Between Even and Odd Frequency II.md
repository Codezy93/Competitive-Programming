# 3445. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency II

---

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the **maximum ** difference between the frequency of **two ** characters, `freq[a] - freq[b]`, in a substring `subs` of `s`, such that:

  * `subs` has a size of **at least ** `k`.
  * Character `a` has an _odd frequency_ in `subs`.
  * Character `b` has an _even frequency_ in `subs`.



Return the **maximum ** difference.

**Note ** that `subs` can contain more than 2 **distinct ** characters.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "12233", k = 4

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

For the substring `"12233"`, the frequency of `'1'` is 1 and the frequency of `'3'` is 2. The difference is `1 - 2 = -1`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "1122211", k = 3

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

For the substring `"11222"`, the frequency of `'2'` is 3 and the frequency of `'1'` is 2. The difference is `3 - 2 = 1`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "110", k = 3

**Output:** -1

 

**Constraints:**

  * `3 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
  * `s` consists only of digits `'0'` to `'4'`.
  * The input is generated that at least one substring has a character with an even frequency and a character with an odd frequency.
  * `1 <= k <= s.length`

## Code
```python
class Solution:
  def maxDifference(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
    ans = -math.inf
    permutations = [(a, b) for a in '01234' for b in '01234' if a != b]
    for a, b in permutations:
      minDiff = collections.defaultdict(lambda: math.inf)
      prefixA = [0]
      prefixB = [0]
      l = 0
      for r, c in enumerate(s):
        prefixA.append(prefixA[-1] + int(c == a))
        prefixB.append(prefixB[-1] + int(c == b))
        while (r - l + 1 >= k and prefixA[l] < prefixA[-1] and prefixB[l] < prefixB[-1]):
          paritiesKey = (prefixA[l] % 2, prefixB[l] % 2)
          minDiff[paritiesKey] = min(minDiff[paritiesKey], prefixA[l] - prefixB[l])
          l += 1
        ans = max(ans, (prefixA[-1] - prefixB[-1]) - minDiff[(1 - prefixA[-1] % 2, prefixB[-1] % 2)])
    return ans

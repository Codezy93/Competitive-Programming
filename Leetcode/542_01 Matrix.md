# 542. 01 Matrix

---

Given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, return _the distance of the nearest_`0` _for each cell_.

The distance between two cells sharing a common edge is `1`.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
**Output:** [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]


**Example 2:**

**Input:** mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
**Output:** [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]


 

**Constraints:**

  * `m == mat.length`
  * `n == mat[i].length`
  * `1 <= m, n <= 104`
  * `1 <= m * n <= 104`
  * `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
  * There is at least one `0` in `mat`.
